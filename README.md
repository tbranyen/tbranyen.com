### About ###

I've open sourced this project to demonstrate using several of my projects
together to accomplish a very specific goal for my personal website.

I started with the idea of a website that had it's content stored in Git.  This
would allow me to keep a paper trail of post updates, which in turn would
encourage me to directly modify the post as well.  So long as every file is
referenced by a specific SHA, that version will be loaded.

I began development of this site in 2011 and put it through many rewrites.  It
is now in a reasonable form fit for consumption by other developers for
reference or reuse.

### What can this framework do for me? ###

I've implemented several specific ideas that may be useful for you:

* Grunt-based workflow taking advantage of LiveReload. 
* All content is stored is in Git, so files may be referenced by revision.
* A custom template syntax that allows code snippets to be referenced and
  automatically highlighted and embedded.
* A performant Node.js Cluster-based server that will spawn to your core count.

### Getting started ###

### Setting up content ###

The website framework has been designed to load an external Git repository of
posts and other content.

By default this folder is named `content` and resides in the root of the site.

To create your own content:

``` bash
# Assuming your structure looks like this.
```
